    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical data for machine learning models. However, they are used in different situations depending on the nature of the categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical data has a natural order or ranking between the categories. For example, educational levels such as \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" and \"Master's Degree\" have a natural order based on the level of education. In this case, ordinal encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category based on its order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, is used when the categorical data does not have a natural order or ranking between the categories. For example, gender categories such as \"Male\" and \"Female\" do not have a natural order. In this case, label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category without any specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that label encoding should not be used for features, but only for target variables. This is because label encoding can create a false sense of order or relationship between the categories, which can lead to incorrect predictions by the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between ordinal encoding and label encoding depends on the nature of the categorical data. If the data has a natural order or ranking, use ordinal encoding. If the data does not have a natural order, use label encoding for target variables only."
