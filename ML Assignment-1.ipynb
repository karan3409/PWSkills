    "1)Artificial Intelligence:\n",
    "- Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, speech recognition, and visual perception. The ultimate goal of AI is to create machines that can mimic or simulate human intelligence to a certain extent.\n",

    "2)Machine Learning:\n",
    "- Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed. ML systems learn from data and iteratively improve their performance over time. There are various types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:A common example of machine learning is recommendation systems, like those used by Netflix or Amazon. These systems use machine learning algorithms to analyze a user's past behavior and preferences, and then recommend products or movies that the user might like.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Deep Learning:\n",
    "- Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to model and solve complex problems. Deep learning algorithms attempt to learn hierarchical representations of data, automatically extracting features at different levels of abstraction. This approach has proven highly effective in tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A common example of deep learning is image recognition, like the technology used in self-driving cars. These systems use deep learning algorithms to recognize and interpret complex patterns in visual data, allowing the car to recognize objects, signs, people, and other vehicles, and make decisions based on this information."

    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by modeling the normal data distribution and defining a measurement in this space to classify samples as anomalous or normal. In high-dimensional data, distances in the original space quickly lose descriptive power, so a mapping to some more suitable space is required.\n",

    "   1.Model Normal Behavior: The unsupervised learning model is trained on a dataset, and it learns to understand the normal patterns or structures in the data. This could be done using clustering algorithms (like K-means), neural networks (like autoencoders), or other methods.\n",

    "   2.Detect Anomalies: Once the model has learned what \"normal\" data looks like, it can then be used to detect anomalies. This is typically done by measuring how much a new data point deviates from the normal pattern that the model has learned. If the deviation is above a certain threshold, the data point is flagged as an anomaly.\n",
